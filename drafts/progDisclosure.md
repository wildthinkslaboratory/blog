The way that we communicate is changing.  In the past, advances in communication like the printing press, the telegraph and the internet, have dramatically shaped the course of history. Each new form of communication increases the exchange of ideas and that leads to innovation and progress in scientific thinking.  Currently, web development and web technology is changing the way we communicate and how we explain complex ideas.  The old world of text and pictures is now joined by video and hyperlinks.  The new fields of data journalism and processing combine text with interactive applications all embedded in the same display.  Interactive visual displays of data or interactive models of scientific ideas allow users to explore questions and test hypotheses in real time.  Educational web sites like Khan Academy create rich learning environments that ask readers to answer questions about the content they've read. With good design, complex ideas become easier to understand.  Currently, these tools are only available to web developers or content writers that can afford to hire web developers.  That is changing.  In a very short time period everyone will be able access these tools when sharing their ideas online.  This post is the first in a series showing simple ways you can use these tools now in your own web content.  No degree in software development required.

### The Larger Context of how Communication is Changing

The way that we communicate is changing.  In the past, advances in communication like the printing press, the telegraph and the internet, have dramatically shaped the course of history. Each new form of communication increases the exchange of ideas and that leads to innovation and progress in scientific thinking.  Currently, web development and web technology is changing the way we communicate and how we explain complex ideas.  The old world of text and pictures is now joined by video and hyperlinks.  The new fields of data journalism and processing combine text with interactive applications all embedded in the same display.  Interactive visual displays of data or interactive models of scientific ideas allow users to explore questions and test hypotheses in real time.  Educational web sites like Khan Academy create rich learning environments that ask readers to answer questions about the content they've read. With good design, complex ideas become easier to understand.  Currently, these tools are only available to web developers or content writers that can afford to hire web developers.

### Definition
Today I'm going to talk about **progressive disclosure** and how you can use it to improve your web content.  Progressive disclosure is a way of presenting content to the user.  The goal is to show the user only what's necessary and relevant, selectively revealing content when it's needed. The user gets to control the flow of content and choose how much detail to reveal.  It's a little bit like Marie Kondo's *the life-changing magic of tidying up*, only for your blog post or web page. Present only what's necessary when it's necessary.  This creates an explanation that's easy to follow and helps the user focus on the most important content without getting distracted my details and asides.

### Definitions, Footnotes, Citations and other Annotations

Written text often requires annotations.  Perhaps you expect most of your readers to be familiar with a [technical](::technical/tooltip) term you are using, but you want to include a definition just in case a reader is unfamiliar with it.  Notice that the definition for the term [technical](::technical/tooltip) appears when you move the mouse over it.  Those familiar with the term can read without interruptions, yet those who need the definition can easily access it if they need it.  

Citations are important for backing up your claims when writing.  For example, there are lots of books about progressive disclosure [[Lidwell et al]](::citation/tooltip).  With progressive disclosure, you don't have to go all the way to the end of the paper to look up the citation.  Just mouse over the citation for instant access.
